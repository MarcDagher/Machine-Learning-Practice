### I can test one by splitting the columns and one by standardization

- Affairs: Change to 0 or 1
- Gender: Change to 0 or 1
- Children: Change to 0 or 1

- Age: Categorize them
- Years of marriage: Categorize them
- Religiousness: 3+ = yes / 2- = no. Change to categories
- Education: 
--- 9 - 12: Grade School
--- 12: High school grad
--- 12 - 17: College 
--- 18 - 20 Masters
--- 20 + Phd

- Occupation: 1 - 7 means that 1 is the best status and 7 is the worst. Either split them into 7 categories or apply a formula on all the dataset
- Rating: 1 - 5 where 1 is unhappy

### Approach 2: Standardization on numerical data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Affairs: Change to 0 or 1
- Gender: Change to 0 or 1
- Children: Change to 0 or 1

- Age, Years of Marriage, Religiousness, Education, Occupation(Needs to be reversed), Rating => Standardization
